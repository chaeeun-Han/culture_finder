# CultureFinder
CultureFinder is for 'Good Health Wellbeing'

* key point of the problem *
- Very hard to find information regarding public facilities/cultural activities(ex. sports, cooking classes) held by government organizations.
- Government Subsidies/Government Programs are hard to find or know about.

So we provides our project to solve these problems.
- Map out public facilities(playgrounds). Public Gyms
- Local government hosted cultural activities / events (cooking classes etc.)
